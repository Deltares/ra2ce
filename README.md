# Ra2ce Examples

This directory contains all (current) available examples of ra2ce. An environment is ready to run them:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ra2ce_examples_env
python import ra2ce
```

At the same time you may use our [binder environment](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Deltares/ra2ce/jupyter-binder).

Please refer to our [Ra2ce documentation](https://deltares.github.io/ra2ce/) for more information.

## Binder requirements.
Binder requires the `apt.txt` and the `environment.yml` files to be present. Do not remove them from this repository.
