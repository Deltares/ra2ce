Technical meetings
=====================

We hold these meetings mostly to share knowledge on new code additions or architectural changes to ``ra2ce``. This can be done in different ways:

- Walk-through the existing code, explaining said changes.
- Discussion based on diagrams (class or flowcharts).
- Hands-on writing code that __uses__ the new functionalities.

Ra2ce is a tool developed by both software engineers and scientists.
In order to achieve a great final product we understand that it should be structured and having the best quality assurance we can provide for it.
However, we also accept that the software needs to be maintained and understood by both parties, therefore we defer from writing functionality only understood by one of said parties.
These tech meetings, and hackathons or user days, help us challenge our own design decissions as well as to find out new desired features.
