Losses Analysis
===============

üöß What happens when infrastructure is disrupted by hazards?
------------------------------------------------------------

The **Losses module** in RA2CE estimates the **economic (indirect) losses** caused
by service disruptions to infrastructure during hazard events.

While the :doc:`Damages module <damages>` answers *‚ÄúHow much does it cost to repair my infrastructure?‚Äù*,
the **Losses module** answers *‚ÄúWhat is the economic impact when my infrastructure cannot function?‚Äù*.

This includes, for example:

- Extra travel time due to blocked or slowed road segments.
- Detour and rerouting costs.
- Productivity and accessibility losses.
- Wider socio-economic impacts of reduced service levels.

Types of Loss Analysis
-----------------------

RA2CE currently supports only one type of losses workflow:

- :doc:`Criticiality based losses <losses.multi_link_redundancy_losses>`
  This is the economic losses due to disruption of road segments, based on the criticality of each link in the network (see details in the :doc:`Criticality analysis <criticality>`).

Direct vs Indirect Impacts
---------------------------

RA2CE distinguishes between **damages** and **losses**:

+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| **Damages**              | **Losses**                                     |
+==========================+================================================+
| Physical repair/rebuild  | Economic cost of disruption                    |
| costs (in ‚Ç¨)             | (in ‚Ç¨)                                         |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Based on *damage curves* | Based on *loss functions* and Value of Time    |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Example: *Cost to repair | Example: *Extra cost from 1h travel delay for  |
| a flooded bridge*        | 10,000 commuters*                              |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

Both are essential in **risk assessment**:
- *Damages* reflect how much money is needed to repair/replace assets.
- *Losses* reflect the broader economic cost of losing access to those assets.
