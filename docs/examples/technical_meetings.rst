Technical meetings
=====================

We hold these meetings mostly to share knowledge on new code additions or architectural changes to ``ra2ce``. This can be done in different ways:

- Walk-through the existing code, explaining said changes.
- Discussion based on diagrams (class or flowcharts).
- Hands-on writing code that __uses__ the new functionalities.

We try to reflect the knowledge shared (and gained) in jupyter notebooks that are later on added to the ``examples`` directory in our GitHub repo.

.. tip::

    Ra2ce is a tool developed by both software engineers and scientists. As such, we understand that it needs to be maintained and understood by both.
    This principle applies to both parties, therefore we defer from writing functionality only understood by one of said parties.

    Tech meetings, and hackathons or user days, help us challenge our own design decissions as well as to find out new desired features.
