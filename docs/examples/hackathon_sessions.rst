Hackathon sessions
=====================

A 'hackathon' is when we gather researchers, software engineers and users together with a specific goal related to the usage or implementation of features within RA2CE.
These sessions are useful as allow each of the stakeholders to sit in other's shoes, improving understanding between them which utterly benefits RA2CE.

We try to summarize a hackathon session in a jupyter notebook. This is not exclusive from further data and information generated during such session. Check their corresponding directory in our GitHub repo (``docs\examples\hackathons``).
