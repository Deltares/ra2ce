Data requirements
-------------------------------------
The types of possible input file formats to create a network are:

•	Shapefile of network;
•	GeoJSON polygon of area of interest for downloading a network from OSM;
•	OSM PBF file;
•	Pickle – a python data format, also used to save graphs.

Depending on the required analysis, more data might be needed. More information about the 
data requirements to create a network can be found in the :ref:`network_module`.

Direct damages
-------------------------------------
The ‘damage to the network’ depends on the intensity of the hazard in relation to how the network (and its assets) are built and its current condition (e.g. type, state of maintenance, dimensions). Here, the hazard intensity and asset condition are linked to a percentage of damage, via vulnerability functions/ fragility curves. To develop these vulnerability curves data is needed about replacements costs per asset type and the potential damage per hazard intensity. This data can be collected during a workshop with for example national road agencies and the technicians. The output of the analyses consist of damage maps per hazard (e.g. flooding, landslides), per return period or per event, per asset and per road segment.

Possible (built-in) options for vulnerability curves include:

- *Global*: Huizinga curves
- *Europe*: OSdaMage functions
- *TO BE IMPLEMENTED*: your own damage curves

**Single link redundancy**
With this analysis, you gain insight into the criticality of the network. A redundancy analysis is performed for each seperate link. It identifies the best existing alternative route if that particular edge would be disrupted. If there is no redundancy, it identifies the lack of alternative routes. This is performed sequentially, for each link of the network. The redundancy of each link is expressed in 1) total distance or total time for the alternative route, 2) difference in distance/time between the alternative route and the original route, 3) and if there is an alternative route available, or not.

**Multi-link redundancy**
This analysis can be performed when there is a hazard map. The hazard map indicates which links are disrupted. The analysis removes multiple disrupted links of the network. For each disrupted link, a redundancy analysis is performed that identifies the best existing alternative route. If there is no redundancy, the lack of alternative routes is specified. The redundancy of each link is expressed in 1) total distance or time for the alternative route, 2) difference in distance/time between the alternative route and the original route (additional distance/time), and 3) whether there is an alternative route available, or not. The user can specify the threshold (in meters) to indicate when a network is considered disrupted. For example, for flooding, the threshold could be a maximum of 0.5 m water on a network segment. Network segments with water depths < 0.5m will then not be considered as flooded.
