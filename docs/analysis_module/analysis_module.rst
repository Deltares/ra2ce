Analysis module
================
RA2CE's analysis module can perform several analyses on infrastructure networks. First, a network needs te be created. Visit the :ref:`network_module` for a better understanding of how this works. In the analysis module we distuingish a module focused on direct monetary road damages (physical damages) and an analysis module for network criticality and origin-destination analyses. The latter are developed from a 'societal losses due to hazards' point of view and provide insight into the hazard impact on the network and the disruption of network services to society. 

Direct/physical damages
-------------------------------------
The physical ‘damage to the network’ depends on the intensity of the hazard in relation to how the network (and its assets) are built and its current condition (e.g. type, state of maintenance, dimensions). Here, the hazard intensity and asset condition are linked to a percentage of damage, via vulnerability functions/ fragility curves. To develop these vulnerability curves data is needed about replacements costs per asset type and the potential damage per hazard intensity. This data can be collected during a workshop with for example national road agencies and the technicians. The output of the analyses consist of damage maps per hazard (e.g. flooding, landslides), per return period or per event, per asset and per road segment.

Possible (built-in) options for vulnerability curves include:

- *Global*: Huizinga curves
- *Europe*: OSdaMage functions
- *TO BE IMPLEMENTED*: your own damage curves

**Single link redundancy**
With this analysis, you gain insight into the criticality of each link in the network. A redundancy analysis is performed for each seperate link. It identifies the best existing alternative route if that particular edge would be disrupted. If there is no redundancy, it identifies the lack of alternative routes. This is performed sequentially, for each link of the network. The redundancy of each link is expressed in 1) total distance or total time for the alternative route, 2) difference in distance/time between the alternative route and the original route, 3) and if there is an alternative route available, or not.

**Multi-link redundancy**
This analysis provides insight into the impact of a hazard in terms of detour time and alternative route length. This analysis can be performed when there is a hazard map. The hazard map indicates which links are disrupted. The analysis removes multiple disrupted links of the network. For each disrupted link, a redundancy analysis is performed that identifies the best existing alternative route. If there is no redundancy, the lack of alternative routes is specified. The redundancy of each link is expressed in 1) total distance or time for the alternative route, 2) difference in distance/time between the alternative route and the original route (additional distance/time), and 3) whether there is an alternative route available, or not. The user can specify the threshold (in meters) to indicate when a network is considered disrupted. For example, for flooding, the threshold could be a maximum of 0.5 m water on a network segment. Network segments with water depths < 0.5m will then not be considered as flooded.

**Origin-Destination, defined OD couples**
RA2CE allows for origin-destination analyses. This analysis finds the shortest (distance-weighed) or quickest (time-weighed) route between all Origins and all Destinations inputted by the user, with and without disruption. The origins and destinations need to be defined by the user. This requires a certain data structure. See the origins-destinations examples notebooks to learn how to do this.

**Origin-Destination, defined origins to closest destinations**
This analysis finds the shortest (distance-weighed) or quickest (time-weighed) route from all Origins to the closest Destinations inputted by the user, with and without disruption. It is possible to create different destination categories (e.g. hospitals, schools and shelters). In that case, RA2CE finds the routes from all origins to the closest destination per destination category (i.e. from each origin to the closest hospital, the closest school and the closest shelter).

**Traffic and equity analysis**
This analysis allows for network criticality analysis taking into account three distributive equity principles: utilitarian, egalitarian and prioritarian principles. For more background knowledge on these principles and the application on transport network criticality analysis, please read: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856420308077> The purpose of the equity analysis is providing insight into how different distributive principles can result in different prioritizations of the network. While we usually prioritize network interventions based on the number of people that use the road, equity principles allow us to also take into account the function of the network for for example underpriviliged communities. Depending on the equity principle applied, your network prioritization might change, which can change decision-making.
This analysis is set up generically so that the user can determine the equity weights themselves. This can for example be GINI-coefficients or social vulnerability scores. The user-defined equity weights will feed into the prioritarian principle. The equity analysis example notebook will guide you through the use of this analysis.
