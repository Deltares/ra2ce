Docker and Cloud guide
=========================

In this section we explore the multiple possibilities regarding 'cloud running'. For such purpose we have documentation covering two different concepts:

- Setting up infrastructure.
   - Building a docker container.
   - Installation and deployment of cloud services.
- Using "cloud services" for specific purposes.
   - Using existing docker images (locally / cloud).
   - Running ``ra2ce`` on different cloud services.
- Guidelines to set up and run from scratch a cloud service


In addition, we also have some known 'use cases' such as setting up and using cloud services for some given use cases such a Hackathons.
