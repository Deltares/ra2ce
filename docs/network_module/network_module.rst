Network Module
==============

The network module is a separate module created within ``RA2CE`` to help set up a RA2CE 
model. It helps to easily, reproducibly and consistently build models from global 
to local datasets. The network module's goal is to create an infrastructure network to be used in further analyses. There are two possibilities to create a network: 1) downloading a network from OpenStreetMap with RA2CE and 2) creating a network from vector data. Within the network module, it is additionally possible to determine the network's exposure to a user-specified hazard using the 'hazard overlay' functionality. There are two options to set up a RA2CE model: using scripting and using initalization files (network.ini and analysis.ini). Examples of how to use this module can be found in the :ref:`examples_index` and can be tested in the Binder environment. 

Data requirements
-------------------------------------
The types of possible input file formats to create a network are:

•	Shapefile of network;
•	GeoJSON polygon of area of interest for downloading a network from OSM;
•	OSM PBF file;
•	Pickle – a python data format, also used to save graphs.

Depending on the required analysis, more data might be needed. Visit the :ref:`analysis_module` page to learn more or explore the :ref:`examples_index` in the Binder environment.

Network from OpenStreetMap using scripting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :py:class:`~ra2ce.graph.network_wrappers.osm_network_wrapper.osm_network_wrapper.OsmNetworkWrapper` 
class can download and process OpenStreetMap data for a given region of interest, using the `osmnx` 
package. The region of interest must be specified with a GeoJSON file.

Additional functionalities in the :py:class:`~ra2ce.graph.network_wrappers.osm_network_wrapper.osm_network_wrapper.OsmNetworkWrapper` 
class include:
- Filtering the OSM data on (road) type
- Assigning the average speed of a road segment based on the maximum speed limit data and road type from OSM
- Adding the missing geometries of the edges (road segments) based on the nodes (intersections)
- Dropping duplicates in nodes and edges
- Snapping nodes to the nearest nodes in the network considering a given threshold
- Snapping nodes to the nearest edges in the network considering a given threshold
- Adding the missing nodes and edges to the network based on the snapped nodes and edges

Examples of how to use this module can be found in the :ref:`examples_index`.

Network from OpenStreetMap using the network.ini initalization file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The network.ini file contains several parts: 1[project], 2[network], 3[origins_destinations], 4[hazard]. These subsections are used to set the parameters necessary for the creation of different networks. Here, we will focus on the [network] part, as this can be used to create a basic network. 
To download a network from OpenStreetMap, the user needs to create a geojson of the extent for which they want to create a network. This .geojson polygon should be stored in the static>network folder of the RA2CE project folder. If you are not yet familiar with the folder setup of a RA2CE project, first visit :ref:`about`.

To create a network from OSM, specify the following parameters in your network.ini file:

**network.ini**
::

    [project]
    name = example_damages

    [network]
    directed = False
    source = OSM download
    primary_file = None
    diversion_file = None
    file_id = id
    polygon = my_extent.geojson
    network_type = drive #if you want to use the drivable roads
    road_types = motorway, motorway_link, trunk, trunk_link #specify road types up to 'residential' and 'unclassified', visit OSM to learn more.
    save_gpkg = True

    [origins_destinations]
    origins = None
    destinations = None
    origins_names = None
    destinations_names = None
    id_name_origin_destination = None
    origin_count = None

    [hazard]
    hazard_map = None
    hazard_id = None
    hazard_crs = None
    aggregate_wl = max

Network from vector data using scripting
--------------------------------------------

There are three ways to create a network from vector data. The first is to clean the 
data yourself before using the Network Module and to then use the :py:class:`~ra2ce.graph.network_wrappers.vector_network_wrapper.VectorNetworkWrapper`
class to read and process the data (e.g., a GeoPackage) to a network. The second 
is to use the :py:class:`~ra2ce.graph.network_wrappers.shp_network_wrapper.ShpNetworkWrapper`
class to read in a shapefile, clean it and process it to a network. The third one is explained below:

Network from vector data using the network.ini initalization file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The user can also read in a pre-defined shapefile using the ra2ce_basics_from_gpkg example notebook, where the user can practice with pre-defined data and required folder structure and data format. The user can upload their own shapefile (vector data), store it in the RA2CE static>network folder and specify the name of the file in the network.ini.

file_id and link_type_column (NetworkSection of the NetworkConfigData or in the network section of network.ini) should refer to the id column and road type columns of the shapefile.

**network.ini**
::

    [project]
    name = example_damages

    [network]
    directed = False
    source = shapefile
    primary_file = my_shapefile.shp
    diversion_file = None
    file_id = id #specify the ID column in your vector data
    link_type_column = highway
    polygon = None
    network_type = drive #if you want to use the drivable roads
    road_types = motorway, motorway_link, trunk, trunk_link #specify road types up to 'residential' and 'unclassified', visit OSM to learn more.
    save_gpkg = True

    [origins_destinations]
    origins = None
    destinations = None
    origins_names = None
    destinations_names = None
    id_name_origin_destination = None
    origin_count = None

    [hazard]
    hazard_map = None
    hazard_id = None
    hazard_crs = None
    aggregate_wl = max

Network overlay with hazard data
--------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to perform overlays with hazard data and the network. RA2CE can handle any hazard data in .tif format. It will return information on where the hazard touches the network and give the hazard attribute to the network (e.g. flood depth on a road segment). RA2CE can additionally use this information in analyses (for example to determine the impact of a hazard on the network and on the routes between origins-destinations)

Specify the hazard file name in the network.ini and set some additional parameters. For full explanation, please see the hazard_overlay example. 

**network.ini**
::

    [project]
    name = example_damages

    [network]
    directed = False
    source = OSM download
    primary_file = None
    diversion_file = None
    file_id = None
    polygon = my_extent.geojson
    network_type = drive #if you want to use the drivable roads
    road_types = motorway, motorway_link, trunk, trunk_link #specify road types up to 'residential' and 'unclassified', visit OSM to learn more.
    save_gpkg = True

    [origins_destinations]
    origins = None
    destinations = None
    origins_names = None
    destinations_names = None
    id_name_origin_destination = None
    origin_count = None

    [hazard]
    hazard_map = my_hazard.tif
    hazard_id = None
    hazard_crs = EPSG:4326 #choose your CRS and specify the correct code
    aggregate_wl = max

Possible parameters network.ini
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: the origin-destination parameters are explained in the :ref:`analysis_module`.

Network simplification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By simplification it is meant to merge links from intersection to intersection.

By default, a simplified graph will be generated and exported. It is possible to exclude links with certain attributes from being merged to other links that have different values for the attributes of interest.

For instance, there might be a case in which we would like to merge links that are not bridges together and merge bridges together. This can be the case for tunnels or any other link type.

To allow such simplification, attributes_to_exclude_in_simplification parameter should be passed (as a list of strings) in the NetworkSection of the NetworkConfigData. Alternatively attributes_to_exclude_in_simplification should be passed (e.g., attributes_to_exclude_in_simplification = bridge, tunnel) in the network.ini file, section network.
