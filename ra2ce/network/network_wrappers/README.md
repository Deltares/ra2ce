# Network wrappers

In this module we define wrappers for reading a ra2ce network (`tuple[MultiGraph, GeoDataFrame]`). Each different class defines how a network will be created and cleaned.
Network wrappers need to instantiate the `NetworkWrapperProtocol`.

An instance of the `NetworkWrapperProtocol` defines the `get_network` method, which will return the aforementioend ra2ce network.

Any network wrapper can be created with the use of a `NetworkConfigData` instance. At the same time, if the user does not know which wrapper to use, the `NetworkWrapperFactory` will resolve this for us.
